## Pool of maintainers of this namespace
The DSM model is part of the IMI project FAIRplus (see <https://www.imi.europa.eu/projects-results/project-factsheets/fairplus>). As such, there is a Consortium Agreement in place which describes the Governance of the project and appoints a designated representative.
